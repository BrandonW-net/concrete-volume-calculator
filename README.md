# Concrete Volume Estimator

### Project Overview
This is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of estimating concrete volume for low-rise forming walls. It provides a more efficient and accurate alternative to the manual methods currently used on many construction job sites.

### Features
* **Accurate Calculation:** The tool correctly calculates the volume of concrete needed for a given wall in both cubic feet and cubic yards.
* **User-Friendly:** The script is interactive, allowing a user to easily input wall dimensions and receive an instant output.
* **Automated Workflow:** The program automates a manual, error-prone process, improving efficiency on the job site.

### How to Run the Code
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/concrete-volume-estimator.git](https://github.com/your-username/concrete-volume-estimator.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd concrete-volume-estimator
    ```
3.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python concrete_calculator.py
    ```

### Coming Soon
* **Batch Processing:** The ability to read multiple wall dimensions from a file to calculate a total volume for an entire job.
* **Report Generation:** The creation of a summary report that lists the volume for each wall and the total volume in a clean, readable format.
* **AI Integration:** The use of computer vision to extract measurements from images of formwork, fully automating the process from photo to final order estimate.
